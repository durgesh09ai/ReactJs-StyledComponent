To covert PPT to images ,we have decided to do it at server side using python. As we already doing processing(sendng the image to the cloud and Digitalization) 
of imges/pDF at server side using Python
There are coupal of approches are there to convert PPT to images 
First Method : Commercial Python library named as aspose.slides.
              Aspose.Slides is a powerful library for working with PowerPoint files in Python. 
              It provides comprehensive functionality for creating, reading, manipulating, and converting PowerPoint presentations (both PPT and PPTX formats)

Second Method : Using LibreOffice in Headless Mode - You can use LibreOffice in headless mode directly. This requires LibreOffice to be installed on your system.
You can call LibreOffice from the command line or from within a Python script.

3rd : Using sme python Library as python-pptx Com interop , Unfortunatly these library directly does not convert the ppt to images,
They are using Exernal and tools and library to achive this.

Slide notes in a PowerPoint presentation are not part of the slide itself; rather, they are metadata associated with a slide.
Slide Content: This includes the elements you see on the slide during a presentation, such as text, images, charts, and other visual elements.
Slide Notes: These are additional notes that a presenter can use to refer to during a presentation. 
They are typically not visible to the audience when the slide is shown, but can be viewed in "Presenter View" or printed out as part of a notes page.
In most libraries or tools for working with PPT files programmatically, slide content and slide notes are accessed separately.
If you're converting slides to images, typically only the visible content of the slide is included in the image, not the slide notes.
