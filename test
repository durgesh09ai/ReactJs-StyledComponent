of imges/pDF at server side using Python
There are coupal of approches are there to convert PPT to images 
First Method : Commercial Python library named as aspose.slides.
              Aspose.Slides is a powerful library for working with PowerPoint files in Python. 
              It provides comprehensive functionality for creating, reading, manipulating, and converting PowerPoint presentations (both PPT and PPTX formats)

Second Method : Using LibreOffice in Headless Mode - You can use LibreOffice in headless mode directly. This requires LibreOffice to be installed on your system.
You can call LibreOffice from the command line or from within a Python script.

3rd : Using sme python Library as python-pptx Com interop , Unfortunatly these library directly does not convert the ppt to images,
They are using Exernal and tools and library to achive this.
