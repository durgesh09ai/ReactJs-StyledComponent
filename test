To covert PPT to images ,we have decided to do it at server side using python. As we already doing processing(sendng the image to the cloud and Digitalization) 
of imges/pDF at server side using Python
There are coupal of approches are there to convert PPT to images 
First Method : Commercial Python library named as aspose.slides.
              Aspose.Slides is a powerful library for working with PowerPoint files in Python. 
              It provides comprehensive functionality for creating, reading, manipulating, and converting PowerPoint presentations (both PPT and PPTX formats)

Second Method : Using LibreOffice in Headless Mode - You can use LibreOffice in headless mode directly. This requires LibreOffice to be installed on your system.
You can call LibreOffice from the command line or from within a Python script.

3rd : Using sme python Library as python-pptx Com interop , Unfortunatly these library directly does not convert the ppt to images,
They are using Exernal and tools and library to achive this.

Slide notes in a PowerPoint presentation are not part of the slide itself; rather, they are metadata associated with a slide.
Slide Content: This includes the elements you see on the slide during a presentation, such as text, images, charts, and other visual elements.
Slide Notes: These are additional notes that a presenter can use to refer to during a presentation. 
They are typically not visible to the audience when the slide is shown, but can be viewed in "Presenter View" or printed out as part of a notes page.
In most libraries or tools for working with PPT files programmatically, slide content and slide notes are accessed separately.
If you're converting slides to images, typically only the visible content of the slide is included in the image, not the slide notes.
--------------------------------------

USING Aspose.Slides

For Slides Notes: 

We can convert the slide notes of a PowerPoint presentation into an image format using Aspose.Slides . 
As the notes will be placed at the bottom of the slide, but if the content of the notes is too large to fit,
it will be truncated (cut off) to avoid overflowing onto the next page or out of the image bounds.

AS i am using free version of Library The truncation of text notes in your output is likely due to the evaluation limitation of the libraries
, specifically Aspose.Slides, which imposes certain restrictions on the amount of data to process.

For Animated PPTX:

We can also convert animated slides into images using Aspose.Slides, but the images generated will be static.
Aspose.Slides can render the appearance of the slide at a specific point in time, but it does not render the animations or transitions as they play out.

It does not directly support converting animations into animated images.To create an animated sequence (like a GIF),
you'd need to manually handle the animation frames and stitch them together.

USING LibreOffice 

For Slides Notes: 

Using LibreOffice converting slide notes into images along with slides directly is not natively supported in LibreOffice through command-line tools.

For Animated PPTX:

LibreOffice itself does not support exporting animations from slides directly into images.
When you export a presentation slide to an image format using LibreOffice, the image will be a static snapshot of the slide without any of the animations.


Subject: Analysis of PowerPoint Slide Conversion Methods

Dear ABC,

I hope this message finds you well.

After conducting a thorough analysis using two variants of PowerPoint presentations, I wanted to share the findings related to the conversion of slide notes and animated slides using both Aspose.Slides and LibreOffice.

Using Aspose.Slides:
1. Slide Notes:
Aspose.Slides supports converting slide notes into image format. The notes are placed at the bottom of the slide, but it's important to note that if the content of the notes exceeds the available space, it will be truncated. This limitation is likely due to the evaluation version of the library, which imposes restrictions on the amount of data processed.

2. Animated Slides:
Aspose.Slides can convert animated slides into images, but the output will be static. While it can render the appearance of the slide at a specific point in time, it does not support the conversion of animations or transitions into animated images like GIFs. Creating an animated sequence would require manually handling each animation frame.

Using LibreOffice:
1. Slide Notes:
LibreOffice does not natively support converting slide notes into images. While it can export slides to image format, the slide notes are not included in this export.

2. Animated Slides:
Similarly, LibreOffice does not support exporting animations from slides into images. The output will be a static snapshot of the slide without any animations.

Conclusion:
After evaluating the capabilities of both tools and considering the pricing of Aspose.Slides, which is quite high, we have decided to proceed with the LibreOffice method despite its lack of support for slide note functionality. This approach offers a more cost-effective solution while still meeting the basic requirements.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there are additional considerations you'd like to discuss.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
